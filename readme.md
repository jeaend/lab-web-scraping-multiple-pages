#### Practice web scraping. **This is not involved with the GNOD project of the week**

As you've seen, scraping the internet is a skill that can get you all sorts of information. Here are some little challenges that you can try to gain more experience in the field. Open a new Jupyter notebook and scrape at least 3 of these sites.

- Retrieve an arbitrary Wikipedia page of "Python" and create a list of links on that page: `url ='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python'`
- Find the number of titles that have changed in the United States Code since its last release point: `url = 'http://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml'`
- Create a Python list with the top ten FBI's Most Wanted names: `url = 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten'`
- Display the 20 latest earthquakes info (date, time, latitude, longitude and region name) by the EMSC as a pandas dataframe: `url = 'https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/'`
- List all language names and number of related articles in the order they appear in [wikipedia.org](wikipedia.org): `url = 'https://www.wikipedia.org/'`
- A list with the different kind of datasets available in [data.gov.uk](data.gov.uk): `url = 'https://data.gov.uk/'`
- Display the top 10 languages by number of native speakers stored in a pandas dataframe: `url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers'`
